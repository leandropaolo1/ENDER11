## Features

- **Enhanced Frame Stability**: Reinforced frame for better print quality.
- **Dual Z-Axis Upgrade**: Smoother and more accurate movements.
- **Improved Cooling System**: Efficient cooling for consistent prints.
- **Better Cable Management**: Cleaner setup with reduced cable clutter.
- **Customizable Build Volume**: Adjustable build volume to fit your needs.
- **Upgraded Firmware**: Advanced features and better user interface.

## Required Parts

- Original Ender 3 parts
- Dual Z-Axis kit
- Upgraded cooling fans
- Cable management sleeves
- Reinforcement brackets
- New firmware (Marlin or similar)

## Assembly Instructions

### Step 1: Disassemble the Original Ender 3

1. Remove the original frame, bed, and electronics.
2. Carefully set aside all parts for reuse.

### Step 2: Reinforce the Frame

1. Install the reinforcement brackets to the frame.
2. Ensure all bolts are tightened securely.

### Step 3: Install the Dual Z-Axis Kit

1. Attach the second Z-axis motor and lead screw.
2. Align both Z-axis lead screws properly for smooth operation.

### Step 4: Upgrade the Cooling System

1. Replace the stock fans with upgraded cooling fans.
2. Ensure proper airflow over the hotend and print area.

### Step 5: Manage the Cables

1. Use cable management sleeves to organize and secure all wires.
2. Route the cables to avoid any interference with moving parts.

### Step 6: Update the Firmware

1. Flash the new firmware to the printerâ€™s mainboard.
2. Configure the firmware settings for optimal performance.
